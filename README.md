## Postman Public API Docs

### Live Links
- Postman public docs: <add-public-docs-link>
- Postman collection (public): <add-collection-link>

### How to Use Postman for Testing

#### 1. Import Collection
- Import `postman/Zorvyn.postman_collection.json`.

#### 2. Import Environment
- Import `postman/Zorvyn.postman_environment.json` and select it.

#### 3. Authentication Flow (Postman)
1. Send `Auth > Login`.
2. The response includes `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
3. The collection auto-saves them into the environment.
4. All protected requests use `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}`.

#### 4. Refresh Token
- Send `Auth > Refresh`.
- The request uses `X-Refresh-Token: {{refreshToken}}`.

### Publish Public Postman Docs
1. In Postman, open the collection and click **Publish Docs**.
2. Choose **Public** visibility.
3. Copy the public docs URL and paste it above.
4. Use **Share** to get the public collection link and paste it above.

### Collection Structure
- Auth
- Users
- Financial Records
- Dashboard

### Example Request Payloads

#### Login
```json
{
  "email": "admin@finance.com",
  "password": "Admin@1234"
}
```

#### Create Financial Record
```json
{
  "amount": 1500.00,
  "type": "INCOME",
  "category": "Salary",
  "recordDate": "2024-01-15",
  "description": "Monthly salary"
}
```

#### Update Financial Record
```json
{
  "amount": 120.75,
  "type": "EXPENSE",
  "category": "Utilities",
  "recordDate": "2024-01-20",

```

### Notes
- Keep Swagger enabled as a secondary reference.
- If publishing publicly, remove real credentials and keep examples only.

## Authentication Flow
1. POST /api/v1/auth/login with email + password
2. Receive accessToken and refreshToken
3. Add to all requests: Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
4. Refresh via POST /api/v1/auth/refresh with X-Refresh-Token header
5. Logout via POST /api/v1/auth/logout

## Sample curl Commands

### Login
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@finance.com","password":"Admin@1234"}'
```

### Create a financial record
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/records \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount":1500.00,"type":"INCOME","category":"Salary","recordDate":"2024-01-15","description":"Monthly salary"}'
```

### Get dashboard summary
```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dashboard/summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

### Get records filtered by type and date range
```
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/records?type=INCOME&startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-12-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

## Assumptions and Design Decisions
- Refresh tokens are stored in-memory (ConcurrentHashMap). In production, these would be stored in Redis or the database.
- Soft delete is used for both users and financial records. Deleted records are filtered at the repository and query layer.
- VIEWER role can read records and summary but cannot create, modify, or access sensitive analytics.
- Audit logging runs asynchronously (@Async) so it never blocks request threads.
- Rate limiting is in-memory per JVM instance. For multi-instance deployments, a distributed store like Redis would be needed.
- Passwords are hashed with BCrypt strength 12.
- All monetary values use BigDecimal to avoid floating-point errors.
- JWT secret must be at least 512 bits in production.

## Future Improvements
- Redis-backed refresh token store and distributed rate limiting
- Email verification on user registration
- Password reset flow
- Export records to CSV/PDF
- Role hierarchy (ADMIN inherits ANALYST inherits VIEWER)
- Multi-tenancy support

## Final Verification Checklist
- [ ] mvn clean compile             — zero errors
- [ ] mvn test                      — all 4 test classes pass
- [ ] mvn spring-boot:run           — app starts on port 8080
- [ ] PostgreSQL running locally    — Flyway applies V1–V6 migrations
- [ ] http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html — Swagger UI loads
- [ ] http://localhost:8080/actuator/health — returns {"status":"UP"}
- [ ] POST /api/v1/auth/login with admin@finance.com / Admin@1234 — returns JWT
- [ ] docker-compose up --build     — both containers start and app is healthy
